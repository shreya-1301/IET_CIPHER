## Project Overview  

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in stock market data, such as unexpected spikes or drops in prices. The end-to-end workflow includes:  
1. Preprocessing raw training and test datasets.  
2. Training an anomaly detection model.  
3. Visualizing detected anomalies.  
4. Applying the model to unseen test data.  
5. Deploying the model for practical use.

## Tasks Breakdown  

### Task 1: Preprocessing of Training Data  

**Objective**: Clean and preprocess the provided training dataset.  
- **Input**: A dataset with columns: `date`, `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume`, `dividends`, `stock splits`.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Handle missing or inconsistent values.  
  - Perform feature engineering to create meaningful inputs.  
  - Scale or normalize features if required.  
- **Output**: A clean and preprocessed dataset ready for model training.  

---

### Task 2: Training a Model  

**Objective**: Train an anomaly detection model using the preprocessed data.  
- **Guidelines**:  
  - Use any machine learning or deep learning algorithm.  
  - Document model selection rationale, training process, and hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Output**: A trained model capable of detecting anomalies in stock market data.  

---

### Task 3: Visualization of Anomalies  

**Objective**: Visualize detected anomalies in the training data.  
- **Steps**:  
  - Split the dataset by year (2004â€“2024).  
  - Use Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization.  
  - Highlight anomalies in clear, insightful plots.  
- **Output**: Year-wise plots showcasing detected anomalies in training data.  

---

### Task 4: Applying the Model to the Test Dataset  

**Objective**: Use the trained model to detect anomalies in the test dataset.  
- **Input**: Test dataset with columns: `date`, `company name`, `adj close`, `close`, `high`, `low`, `open`, `volume`.  
- **Output**: A CSV file listing `company name` and `date` for each detected anomaly.  

---

### Brownie Task: Model Deployment  

**Objective**: Deploy the anomaly detection model as a user-friendly application.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - The application should accept a CSV file as input and output detected anomalies.  
  - Use tools like Streamlit, Flask, or FastAPI for deployment.  
- **Output**:  
  - A demo video showcasing the deployment and its usage.  
  - Code for loading and using the model.  
  - Saved model file for evaluation.
