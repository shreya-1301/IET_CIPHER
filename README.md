Anomaly Detection App
Overview
This is an anomaly detection application that uses machine learning models to detect anomalies in stock price data. The app allows users to upload a CSV file, and it will identify anomalies based on the stock prices over time.

Features
Upload a CSV file with stock data (e.g., Date, Close prices).
Anomaly detection using the IsolationForest algorithm.
Displays dates with detected anomalies.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x

pip install pandas scikit-learn streamlit matplotlib
Usage
1. Run the App Locally
You can run the Streamlit app 
2. Upload a CSV File
Once the app is running:

Navigate to http://localhost:8501.
Upload your stock data CSV file.
The app will process the file and identify dates with anomalies based on stock prices.
File Format for CSV
The app expects the CSV file to have at least two columns:

Date: The date of the stock data (in YYYY-MM-DD format).
Close: The closing price of the stock on that date.


Prepare the Anomaly Detection Model: You can use the IsolationForest from scikit-learn for anomaly detection. Below is a simple example that reads a CSV, applies the model, and identifies anomalies.

Create a Python file called anomaly_detection_app.py 
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Streamlit UI setup
st.title('Stock Price Anomaly Detection')
st.markdown('Upload a CSV file containing stock data with `Date` and `Close` columns.')

How It Works:

File Uploader: The app allows the user to upload a CSV file using Streamlit's file uploader.
Data Processing: Once the file is uploaded, the app reads the CSV, checks for missing values, and applies the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the Close column (stock price).
Anomalies: The anomalies are marked with a red cross on the graph, and the app displays the dates and stock prices of these anomalies.
Plotting: It also plots the stock prices with anomalies highlighted.
Running the Streamlit App: After saving the code to anomaly_detection_app.py, you can run the app locally by using the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run anomaly_detection_app.py
This command will launch the app, and it will be available at http://localhost:8501 (by default).

Testing the App:
Upload a CSV file that contains Date and Close columns (example: stock price data).
The app will process the file, detect anomalies, and display the results.

Example Output:
Anomalies Detected: The app will output the dates and stock prices where the anomaly was detected.
Plot: The plot will show the stock price over time, with the anomalies marked in red.
Conclusion:
You now have an anomaly detection app deployed locally that accepts CSV file input and shows identified anomalies with visualizations using Streamlit.

This app works by:

Reading stock data from a CSV file.
Applying the IsolationForest algorithm to detect anomalies in the Close prices.
Displaying the anomalies in both a table and a plot.
