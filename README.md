<h1>Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest</h1>
<h2>üöÄProject Overview</h2>
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in a given dataset using the Isolation Forest algorithm. The pipeline includes:

**Data Cleaning**
Data Visualization (preliminary insights)
Model Training with Isolation Forest
Evaluation and Visualization of Results
<h2>üìä Dataset</h2>
**Dataset Name**: Visualization.ipynb (placeholder for the cleaned dataset)
**Source**: Provided as input
**Features**: Describe the key attributes used for anomaly detection (e.g., numerical features, categorical features, timestamps).
<h2>üîçObjective</h2>
To identify anomalies/outliers within the dataset through an unsupervised learning approach using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

<h2>‚öôÔ∏èWorkflow</h2>
1. **Data Cleaning**
The following preprocessing steps were performed on the dataset:

Handling missing values
Removing duplicates
Encoding categorical variables (if any)
Normalization or scaling for numerical features
2. **Visualization**
Basic visualizations (e.g., histograms, boxplots, scatter plots) were created to understand the data distribution and identify patterns or potential outliers visually.

3. **Model Training**
The Isolation Forest algorithm, an unsupervised outlier detection method, was applied. Key steps include:

Importing the necessary libraries
Splitting the data into training and test sets (if needed)
Fitting the Isolation Forest model on the dataset
**Hyperparameters:**

n_estimators: 100 (number of base estimators)
contamination: Auto-estimated or manually set based on domain knowledge
max_samples: Sub-sampling size for tree training
4. Results and Evaluation
The model generates anomaly scores and identifies points as anomalies (outliers) or normal observations. The following metrics and visualizations are used to interpret results:

Anomaly Score Distribution: Visualization of scores using histograms.
Anomaly Detection Scatter Plot: Scatter plots highlighting anomalies.
Evaluation: If labeled data exists, precision, recall, or F1-score can be computed for validation.
